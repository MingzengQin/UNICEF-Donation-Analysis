# UNICF-Donation-Analysis
UNICEF Data Analytics Project — Donor Behavior & Campaign Optimization

This project was conducted as part of a data analytics initiative focused on supporting UNICEF fundraising and donor engagement strategies through data-driven insights.

The objective of the project was to analyze donor behavior and campaign performance using historical transaction and engagement data, and to develop actionable insights that could improve donation response rates and long-term donor value.

Key components of the project include:

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed donation patterns, campaign timing, donor frequency, and response behaviors to identify key trends and anomalies.

*Feature Engineering:
Created meaningful behavioral features such as recency, frequency, donation intervals, campaign exposure timing, and engagement indicators to better capture donor intent.

*Predictive Modeling:
Built and evaluated machine learning models to predict donor response likelihood for future fundraising campaigns.

*Business Insights & Recommendations:
Translated analytical findings into practical recommendations for campaign targeting, personalization, and resource allocation.

Due to data confidentiality and ethical considerations, raw donor data is not included in this repository. All analysis and modeling work is presented using anonymized structures and reproducible workflows.

This project demonstrates the application of data analytics and machine learning techniques to real-world nonprofit and social-impact contexts, with a strong emphasis on interpretability, ethical data use, and decision-oriented insights.
